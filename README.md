[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mcelis13/MessengerAPI.svg?branch=travis-setup)](https://travis-ci.org/mcelis13/MessengerAPI)

This project was built using node.js.  This is the API for my messenger web application.  This web application allows you to create an account and send messages to anyone who is already registered and logged into the web application.  To run this project download the project, open it up in your terminal and run nodemon index.js in your terminal. You will be able to access the project by going to localhost:3000 on your Chrome browser.  To access the front-end of this project download the messenger repo located at https://github.com/mcelis13/messenger . Once you have downloaded the folder open it up in your terminal and run the npm install && npm start commands on your terminal.  You will need to give the terminal permission to open up the server on port 3001.  To access messenger folder on your Chrome browser go to localhost:3001.  There you will find the project.  This web application is currently still a work in progress (I currently have a bug in my register function).  To test out the messaging feature you can log in using a dummy user and you can open up another incognito window and use another dummy user to test the web application.  

dummy user account 1: (email: jeffrey@gmail.com and use the password: 123456)
dummy user account 2: (email: vp@gmail.com and use the password: 123)

You must be logged into both users to send messages and be in the same conversation.
